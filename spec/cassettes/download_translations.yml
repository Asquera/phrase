        The Enterprise\n      the_story_text: ! \"<p>Wimdu was founded by Arne Bleckwenn
        and Hinrich Dreiling,\n        two close friends who met each other at university
        and who had successfully\n        founded two companies together before establishing
        Wimdu.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Whilst\n        traveling the world together, the
        duo became increasingly dissatisfied with\n        expensive, anonymous hotels.
        As an alternative, they found that guests were\n        choosing private rentals
        – a concept which offered guests cheaper, more personal\n        accommodation
        options and an overall more authentic holiday experience. Further\n        research
        revealed that an established platform for this kind of concept was\n        missing
        in Europe. And thus, the pair decided to create a company which would\n        combine
        technical know-how, a passion for travel and a closer attention to\n        the
        individual needs of users, all rooted in the unique flavor of Berlin.\n        The
        result of this is Wimdu.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We are a diverse team of highly-qualified\n
        \       and enthusiastic people all aiming to turn private, home-grown rentals
        into\n        an easy to use global norm. We want to change the way people
        travel into something\n        more real and personal, to help them 'travel
        like a local', as our slogan\n        suggests. Our large team of over 350
        people is located not only in our Berlin\n        headquarters, but is spread
        out in many locations all over the world.</p>\"\n      the_story_title: The

        They are personable,\n        clean and tidy as well as very respectful. Everything

        with budget in mind. We found accommodation with Wimdu as we\n        wanted
        a local and more personal experience where we would get to meet other\n        people.
        We have only positive things to say. Ahman and Bruce were friendly\n        and
        hospitable. They have a lovely home (...) We regret that we only stayed\n
        \       for three days!\n      testimonial_3: When you open the door of your

        We had such a good time with them.\n        Nicole and Anne are very nice
        persons, very easy- going, friendly an with\n        a lot of enthusiasm.
        We highly recommend them to any host. We wish this mother\n        and daughter
        all the best for life. Thanks for choosing us and you are very\n        welcomed
        to come back again anytime. Greets from Anna and Jordy, Barcelona\n        :)\n
        \     testimonial_4: Both our hosts made us feel very welcome. Being in a
        strange\n        city with my daughter it was great to have the house of Anna
        and Jordy as\n        our 'home base'. It is easy to get to every place in
        Barcelona by subway or\n        by foot, and being so close to the Park Guell
        makes it extra special. (...)\n        But our stay was especially great because
        of the care Anna and Jordy show\n        for their guests. Go visit them!

        hosts to upload a minimum of three photos for each listing,\n          and
        most of our hosts upload more. If you would like to see more photos\n          of
        a listing, we suggest sending a message to a host expressing your interest.\n
        \       answer_2: We display a basic indication of where an accommodation
        is located,\n          limited to the street name and a map of the surrounding
        area. We withhold\n          its exact street address in order to protect
        a host's privacy. Guests will\n          only receive it once their booking
        has been confirmed.\n        answer_3: We feature a broad range of property
        types, ranging from apartments\n          and houses to boats and tents. Explore
        our listings and you'll be surprised\n          what you can find!\n        answer_4:
        Some listings may be new on Wimdu or previous guests may not yet\n          have
        left a review. Listings will gradually acquire reviews over time.\n        answer_5:
        This is different for each individual accommodation and can be viewed\n          in
        the ‘Amenities’ tab. If you have a question about a particular offer,\n          you
        can ask the host directly by sending them a message on our messaging\n          service.
        Just click the ‘Contact me’ button beside the host’s picture on\n          the
        listing you’d like to inquire about.\n        answer_6: Hosts are welcome
        to change the prices for different dates. There\n          can be a number
        of reasons for this, including these days being within a\n          peak booking
        time.\n        answer_7: You may use the messaging system to contact hosts.
        We are happy\n          to encourage communication between hosts and guests.
        However, attempts to\n          transfer contact information through the messaging
        system will be automatically\n          rejected.\n        answer_8: This
        is different for each individual property. You will find the\n          maximum
        number of guests in the details list on the offer pages.\n        question_1:
        Why do some offers only contain a few photos?\n        question_2: What details
        about the location of a property are visible?\n        question_3: Which types
        of accommodation are available on Wimdu?\n        question_4: Why do some
        properties have few or no reviews?\n        question_5: Are guests allowed
        to bring pets with them to their accommodation?\n        question_6: Why are
        the prices different for certain dates?\n        question_7: How do I make
        contact with a host?\n        question_8: How many people are allowed to stay
        in a particular property?\n        title: Viewing an offer\n      section_2:\n
        \       answer_1: Yes. You can view whether a property is available by selecting
        the\n          'Availability' tab on an offer page.\n        answer_10: The
        host will be notified about your booking request and once they\n          have
        either accepted or refused your booking, you will receive further instructions\n
        \         from us.\n        answer_2: If you have questions for the host,
        you are welcome to use the messaging\n          system to contact them. For
        anything else, please <a href='/contact_requests/new'\n          title='contact
        our customer support team' class='zendesk-chat-link'>contact\n          our
        customer support team</a>.\n        answer_3: Once we have confirmed your
        payment details, we will reserve the\n          total booking cost in your
        account. Once this has been completed, you will\n          receive your host's
        complete address.\n        answer_4: The total of your booking will be reserved
        in your bank account\n          or Paypal account immediately after you have
        made the booking request. The\n          amount will only be deducted from
        your account if the host accepts your\n          request.\n        answer_5:
        If you cannot commit to a booking request, or even a booking that\n          has
        already been confirmed, <a href='/contact_requests/new' title='send\n          an
        email to our customer support team' class='zendesk-chat-link'>please\n          send
        an email to our customer support team</a> and we will advise you further.\n
        \       answer_6: We have a policy that requires our hosts to respond to booking
        requests\n          within 24 hours, although almost all of our hosts respond
        a lot sooner than\n          this. If a host does not respond within 24 hours,
        we automatically cancel\n          any booking requests and will assist you
        in finding an alternative. When\n          your booking request expires or
        is refused by the host, the total booking\n          amount reserved in your
        account will be automatically released. This can\n          take 3-5 working
        days to reach your account. Since there is no confirmed\n          booking,
        Wimdu will not charge you.\n        answer_7: There are a number of reasons
        for this. Wimdu charges a 12% service\n          fee on the total price of
        a booking. In addition to this, a host may charge\n          a cleaning fee,
        a fee for extra guests, or a particular night may have a\n          higher
        nightly rate.\n        answer_8: Wimdu does not currently process deposits
        for our hosts. However,\n          some hosts may wish to ask for a deposit
        anyway. They must inform you of\n          this either in the description
        of their property, or in their direct communication\n          with you. As
        a general rule, deposits will be returned once your host is\n          satisfied
        with the condition of their property. If any issues arise with\n          a
        deposit mentioned in a listing, <a href='/contact_requests/new' title='contact\n
        \         our customer support team' class='zendesk-chat-link'>please contact
        our\n          customer support team</a>.\n        answer_9: Some hosts charge
        a cleaning fee. Details of the cleaning fee will\n          be on the 'Details'
        list on the offer page.\n        question_1: Can I find out if a property
        is available on a particular date\n          before I attempt to book it?\n
        \       question_10: What happens after I click 'Complete Booking'?\n        question_2:
        What do I do if I have questions I'd like answered before I make\n          a
        booking?\n        question_3: When will I receive the host's complete contact
        and address details?\n        question_4: When will my credit card, bank account
        etc. be charged for my\n          booking?\n        question_5: Can I change
        my mind after making a booking?\n        question_6: How long does it usually
        take to receive an acceptance or a refusal\n          from a host?\n        question_7:
        Why is the price on the checkout page different to the price on\n          the
        search page?\n        question_8: Do I have to pay a deposit?\n        question_9:
        Do I have to pay a cleaning fee?\n        title: Booking an offer\n      section_3:\n
        \       answer_1: You can contact a host using the messaging system on the
        offer page.\n          However, exchanging contact information is not permitted.\n
        \       answer_2: Some hosts have not yet completed their profiles. If you
        are seeking\n          more information, we advise you to contact them via
        the messaging system\n          on the offer page.\n        answer_3: We encourage
        all of our hosts to use photos of themselves, but we\n          have not made
        it an obligation and they are free to use an appropriate picture\n          of
        their choice.\n        answer_4: Some listings may be new on Wimdu or previous
        guests may not have\n          left a review yet. Listings will gradually
        acquire reviews over time.\n        answer_5: If you have a problem with a
        host and cannot resolve it personally,\n          we advise you to contact
        our customer support team. If you feel it is necessary\n          to make
        a cancellation, this must be submitted via <a href='/contact_requests/new'\n
        \         title='Submit an email to our customer support team' class='zendesk-chat-link'>email\n
        \         to our customer support team</a>.\n        answer_6: If a host does
        not respond to a booking request within 24 hours,\n          the booking will
        automatically be cancelled and we will contact you to arrange\n          an
        alternative.\n        answer_7: The handover of keys should be discussed with
        the host before traveling\n          to your accommodation. The host will
        advise you on a time and place, if\n          this is different to the location
        of the accommodation.\n        question_1: How can I contact the host of a
        property I'm interested in booking?\n        question_2: Why are some hosts'
        profiles incomplete?\n        question_3: Why do some hosts not have a photo
        of themselves as their profile\n          picture?\n        question_4: Why
        do some properties have few or no reviews?\n        question_5: What should
        I do if I encounter problems with a host?\n        question_6: What should
        I do if a host doesn't respond to a booking request?\n        question_7:
        How does the key handover work?\n        title: Knowing your host\n      section_4:\n
        \       answer_1: Hosts can select one of three cancellation policies. You
        can find\n          more information about these on our <a href='/aboutus#about-us-terms-and-privacy'\n

        your problem\n          with you.\n        answer_2: No. Your Facebook account
        is only used to bypass our regular registration\n          tool. We do not
        include any other Facebook information in your Wimdu profile.\n          You
        will have to complete your profile manually.\n        answer_3: Leaving a
        review is a great way to give feedback on your stay, which\n          is extremely
        useful for future guests.\n        answer_4: We are constantly in the process
        of getting to know our hosts better,\n          and the Wimdu Verified status
        will continue to be added to more listings\n          over time.\n        answer_5:
        We accept all major credit cards and PayPal. In Germany, we accept\n          bank
        transfers.\n        answer_6: Yes. All payments are processed through encrypted
        connections.\n        answer_7: If you would like to make a complaint, <a
        href='/contact_requests/new'\n          title='email our customer support
        team' class='zendesk-chat-link'>please\n          email our customer support

        must be submitted within 24 hours of checking in to your\n          accommodation.\n
        \       answer_8: Wimdu screens all of its hosts and does not make their listings\n
        \         available for search unless they are up to standard. Additionally,
        the host\n          will only receive payment at least 24 hours after you
        have checked in, which\n          protects you in case your stay does not
        go according to plan.\n        answer_9: Refunds are processed according to

        possible cancellation policies'>Cancellation Policy page</a>.\n          If
        you are eligible for a refund, this payment will be transferred on the\n          same
        day that your cancellation has been confirmed by Wimdu. This payment\n          can
        take between 3-5 days to appear in your account.\n        question_1: What
        are Wimdu's policies on cancellations?\n        question_10: What should I
        do if I have a problem when arriving at my accommodation?\n        question_2:
        If I sign-in with my Facebook account, will it be visible on my\n          profile?\n
        \       question_3: Why should I leave a review?\n        question_4: What
        if a host's property does not have Wimdu Verified status?\n        question_5:

        Wimdu help me avoid fraudulent hosts?\n        question_9: How are refunds
        processed if a booking doesn't work out?\n        title: Your safety\n      section_5:\n
        \       answer_1: In order to process your bookings securely and improve user
        transparency,\n          we require that you create a Wimdu account. This
        also allows you to keep\n          records of your bookings on our system
        and assists us in providing you the\n          best possible support.\n        answer_2:
        One of the reasons Wimdu was created was to help make traveling\n          a
        more personal, local experience. Since we focus on offering properties\n          owned
        by individuals, we feel it is necessary, as well as greatly enhancing\n          your
        experiences, to provide a way for potential hosts to get to know you\n          better
        in advance.\n        answer_3: This is not obligatory, but we recommend it
        nevertheless.\n        answer_4: If you forget your password, there is a link
        on the sign-in page\n          to help you create a new one.\n        answer_5:
        No. Your Facebook account is only used to bypass our regular registration\n
        \         tool. We do not include any other Facebook information in your Wimdu
        profile.\n          You will have to complete your profile manually.\n        answer_6:

        Subletting your property is legal in most countries. However, if\n          you

        \       title: Listing your property\n      section_2:\n        answer_1:
        When a guest makes a booking request for your property, you will\n          receive
        an email advising you on how to accept or reject it. Alternatively,\n          you
        can accept or reject bookings in the 'My Guests' section of your account.\n
        \       answer_2: Yes. We charge our hosts 3% of the sum total to cover processing\n
        \         and handling costs. Guests are charged 12% of their sum total when
        booking\n          your listing.\n        answer_3: Yes. You can modify the
        price for individual nights in the calendar\n          section of your listing.
        You can access this by going to the 'My Offers'\n          section of your
        account, and selecting 'View Offer Calendar'. To change\n          a nightly
        price, please select a date and enter your desired new price in\n          the
        pop-up window.\n        answer_4: Yes. You can enter a cleaning fee in the
        'Pricing and Terms' option\n          once you have selected 'Modify Offer'
        from the My Offers section of your\n          account. The cleaning fee is
        located in 'Additional Costs'.\n        answer_5: Deposits may be charged,
        but are currently not processed through\n          Wimdu. You will have to
        mention it in your description and collect it from\n          your guest upon
        their checking in. Deposits are a private matter between\n          hosts
        and their guests.\n        answer_6: We have three different cancellation
        policies available for you\n          to select, and each one has different
        implications for your guest. You can\n          find more information about

        Yes, Wimdu charges its hosts a 3% fee of the sum total to cover\n          the
        processing and handling of your bookings.\n        answer_9: Some listings
        require you to send the host a message before you\n          can make a booking
        request. Once the host has confirmed their availability,\n          you can
        then proceed to book their listing.\n        question_1: I've received a booking

        Receiving bookings\n      section_3:\n        answer_1: We provide a messaging
        system that allows our hosts and guests to\n          communicate. You can
        use this to ask for further information when necessary.\n          However,
        exchanging contact details is prohibited for security reasons.\n        answer_2:
        A guest will receive your address once we have reserved the total\n          fee
        on their chosen method of payment.\n        answer_3: This is entirely your
        choice. We do not expect you to provide additional\n          host services,
        but some guests will appreciate the option of a train station/airport\n          pick-up,
        or even a short tour of the neighbourhood!\n        answer_4: This is not
        a requirement, but it is preferred. Ultimately, what\n          matters is
        that the handover of keys is agreed with your guest in advance,\n          and
        that this happens according to the plan you have discussed, whether\n          you
        hand them over yourself or a third party does it for you.\n        answer_5:

        view of the surrounding neighbourhood.\n        answer_5: We transfer payment
        at least 24 hours after your guest has checked\n          in. Payment will
        be transferred into the account you have specified in your\n          Wimdu
        account settings.\n        answer_6: If you are not happy with a potential
        guest, you are of course allowed\n          to reject their bookings. However,
        rejecting bookings regularly will affect\n          your position in the search
        results and may even cause your listing to be\n          taken offline. If,

        particular day, please mark it as unavailable in the 'View Offer\n          Calendar'

        System. You can ask them about\n            things such as the purpose of

        Write down your house rules\n            and leave them in the guest's room
        for them. Also, you can write down\n            your guest's information (e.g.

        That's why we provide comprehensive insurance which benefits\n        both
        guests and hosts. Every guest who books accommodation on Wimdu is automatically\n
        \       insured against damages they (or a guest accompanying them) may cause
        to rented\n        property. This way we can protect hosts and guests, in
        cooperation with our\n        well-established insurance partner.\n      traveling:\n

        Tell us about yourself\n          subheader1_content: Wimdu hosts often want
        to know who is going to stay\n            with them. Therefore, you should
        use the opportunity presented to you\n            by your Wimdu profile to
        tell people about yourself. Write about where\n            you are from, why
        you enjoy traveling, what your hobbies are and which\n            languages
        you speak. Sharing these things ahead of time can help make\n            your
        stay much more personal.\n          subheader2: Use your network\n          subheader2_content:
        If you already have a Facebook account, with a single\n            click you
        can connect to Wimdu via Facebook. This can make maintaining\n            your
        Wimdu profile much easier, plus you can see which of your friends\n            have
        already used Wimdu.\n          subheader3: Post a picture of yourself\n          subheader3_content:

        host's Wimdu profile. Here you can see\n            if you have any common
        ground, and find out if you even speak the same\n            language. Through
        Wimdu's messaging system you can ask questions and clear\n            up a
        lot of potential issues before you arrive.\n          subheader2: Double check

        spend some time looking at the house rules\n            once you've checked
        out the description of the room. This way you can\n            be sure that
        this is really the right accommodation for you. The reviews\n            of
        former guests can also be a valuable indication of the quality of the\n            host
        and their apartment offer.\n          subheader3: Use Wimdu\n          subheader3_content:
        Wimdu verifies the validity and quality of every host\n            we list.
        We deal with the payment from you to the host and the transmission\n            of
        accommodation information. Should a host attempt to work with you outside\n
        \           of Wimdu, please report the incident to our service team.\n        headline3:\n

        money on to the host only 24 hours after\n            your scheduled arrival.
        If anything is not in order or not in accordance\n            with what was
        expected, please inform us immediately so we can work towards\n            a
        solution. If anything in the apartment is damaged, make sure to document\n
        \           this with pictures to ensure that you are not held responsible.\n

        PayPal is the most preferred way to pay online in the UK because\n          it's

        information\n          every time you shop. You speed through checkout in

        directly, and your payment details\n          are never shared on the internet.\n

        and Conditions (GTC) apply to the\n          use of the platform www.wimdu.com.
        The platform www.wimdu.com is a service\n          of the Wimdu GmbH ('wimdu'
        or 'we'). wimdu provides you (as 'User') its\n          services, especially
        the use of the database, based on these user conditions.\n        item_02:
        1.2 By registering or using our services, you consent to the application\n
        \         of these terms of use.\n        item_03: 1.3 wimdu reserves the
        right to change the terms of use to take effect\n          in the future.
        In this case, the changes are only then part of the contract\n          if
        the user consents to such changes. It is sufficient for this purpose\n          that
        wimdu provides a new version of the GTC to the user via e-mail, that\n          the
        user does not contradict these changes within four weeks, and whereupon\n
        \         wimdu will explicitly indicate to the user that these GTC are sent.\n
        \       item_04: 1.4 Differing business conditions of the users are not valid,
        even\n          if wimdu does not contradict individual cases.\n        title:
        Scope, Amendments of Terms of Use\n      section_02:\n        item_01: ! '2.1
        The website www.wimdu.com is an online platform. Natural or\n          legal
        persons and business partnerships that have registered, and whose\n          registration
        has been confirmed by wimdu (hereinafter: ''User''), can provide\n          and
        rent apartments, rooms or other accommodations (''accommodation'').\n          The
        conclusion of the user contract is free.'\n        item_02: 2.2 wimdu provides
        a website platform for posting content and offers,\n          making contacts,
        and preparing and concluding rental contracts. Rental contracts\n          come
        to stand exclusively between the offering user (“provider”) and the\n          renting
        user (“renter”). wimdu itself does not provide its own accommodations\n          and
        does not accept any offers. wimdu is not a party in the contract concluded\n
        \         between the users on the website. Wimdu is entitled to act with
        power to\n          contract on behalf of the provider and arranges accommodation
        between renter\n          and provider, however does not fulfill any obligations
        derived from the\n          contractual relationship between renter and provider.
        The fulfillment of\n          the contracts concluded between users on the
        website is solely between users.\n        item_03: 2.3 Rental offers and content
        posted by users on the website will\n          not be verified by wimdu as
        to their legality, accuracy or completeness\n          and do not represent
        the views of wimdu. wimdu is not responsible for third\n          party offerings
        and content.\n        title: wimdu's services\n      section_03:\n        item_01:
        3.1 The use of wimdu's services requires that the user has previously\n          registered.
        Registration is free and requires that the user accept the GTC.\n          By
        receiving a confirmation e-mail at the user-specified e-mail address\n          by
        wimdu, a contract between wimdu and the user to use wimdu's services\n          ('user
        contract') comes to stand. There is no legal right to conclude such\n          a
        user contract.\n        item_02: 3.2 Registration is allowed only to unrestricted,
        legal capacity\n          natural persons, legal persons and partnerships.
        Minors may not register\n          with wimdu. The registration of a legal
        person or partnership may be made\n          only by an authorized natural
        person who must be named. During the registration,\n          only individuals
        may be listed as the owner of the user account (i.e. no\n          married
        couples or families).\n        item_03: 3.3 During the registration, the user
        is obligated to provide accurate,\n          up-to-date and complete information
        as required by the registration form,\n          especially first and last
        name, current address (a PO Box is not acceptable),\n          a valid e-mail
        address and, where appropriate, to state the name of the\n          company
        and an authorized representative. The data must be up-to-date and\n          correct
        at all times. Multiple registrations under different member names\n          are
        prohibited. During registration the user chooses a user ID and password.\n
        \         The member name may not be an e-mail or Internet address, may not
        be damaging\n          to the names, trademarks or rights of others, nor offend
        against good manners.\n          After registration, the user receives a password
        and a name assigned to\n          his membership account.\n        item_04:
        3.4 Legal transaction declarations (e.g. confirmation messages, changes\n
        \         to the GTC) may be sent to user by e-mail.\n        title: Registration,
        Formation of the user contract, Legal transaction declarations\n      section_04:\n
        \       item_01: 4.1 The user is obligated to maintain up-to-date and accurate
        information\n          in his membership accounts, and in the event of a change,
        to correct it\n          immediately. A user account is not transferable and
        not inheritable.\n        item_02: 4.2 The user is obligated to ensure that
        his membership account is\n          only used by himself and is obligated
        for this purpose to keep his password\n          secret.\n        item_03:
        4.3 Users are liable for all activities that are carried out while\n          their
        member account is used. The user is not liable if he was not responsible\n
        \         for the misuse of his membership account as long as the existing
        duty of\n          care was not violated.\n        item_04: 4.4 Once the user
        is aware that third parties have access to his\n          member account or
        have otherwise gained access to his member's account,\n          he shall
        forthwith notify wimdu. wimdu shall then block the member's account\n          until
        the situation has been clarified. The expenses incurred to the account\n          until
        it was blocked shall be paid by the user, unless disclosure of the\n          access
        data is due to a fault of wimdu.\n        item_05: 4.5 wimdu only carries
        out a very limited review of registration\n          data, as the identification
        of people in the Internet is only very restrictedly\n          possible. Consequently,
        despite various security precautions, it is not\n          possible to exclude
        that incorrect data was provided for a user account.\n          Each user
        has to convince himself of the identity of his contractual party.\n        item_06:
        4.6 Users are obligated to set their systems and programs in connection\n
        \         with the use of wimdu's services so that neither the security, integrity\n
        \         or the availability of systems set up by wimdu to provide their
        services,\n          are affected. Users may not block wimdu generated content,
        rewrite, modify\n          or in any way interfere with wimdu's services.
        wimdu has the right to set\n          up necessary measures (such as blocking
        access) that are necessary to ensure\n          the system integrity of wimdu's
        systems or third parties.\n        item_07: 4.7 Users are responsible to archive
        on a storage medium independent\n          of wimdu the visible information
        on the website and information stored by\n          wimdu, which they deem
        necessary for their own purposes of evidence, accounting,\n          etc.\n
        \       title: ! 'User obligations: user account, system integrity'\n      section_05:\n
        \       item_01: 5.1 The user is responsible that the accommodation he offers
        is described\n          correctly and completely. He must at least provide
        the information in the\n          mandatory fields in wimdu, so that the accommodation
        and the offer is adequately\n          described. In addition, it is up to
        the provider to request additional conditions,\n          such as a deposit
        amount, the cost of cleaning, the possibility of canceling,\n          etc.
        The various, contractual cancellation policies can be found at the\n          following
        %{href_cancellation_policy} .\n        item_02: 5.2 Users are obligated to
        comply with applicable laws when using\n          the website. wimdu therefore
        prohibits, for example, to offer accommodations,\n          whose offer and/or
        application violates statutory provisions, infringes\n          on the rights
        of third parties or offends against good manners.\n        item_03: 5.3 It
        is the sole responsibility of each user to ensure that his\n          offers
        are legal and do not infringe on the rights of third parties.\n        item_04:
        5.4 Users may not use addresses, contact details and e-mail addresses,\n          which
        they have obtained through the use of the site for any purpose other\n          than
        for the pre-contractual and contractual communication. It is especially\n
        \         forbidden to sell this data or to use it to send advertising, unless
        the\n          user in question has expressly agreed in advance.\n        item_05:
        5.5 The website content stored by wimdu may not be copied or distributed\n
        \         without prior consent of the respective owners, or otherwise used
        or reproduced.\n          This also applies to copying in the way of search
        engine technologies or\n          via other automatic mechanisms.\n        title:

        not be injurious to the rights of third parties,\n          in particular,
        injure personality rights or copyrights of third parties.\n        item_02:

        to bid on the proposed property with the specified\n          conditions (rent,
        etc.) and will conclude with a rental contract. The renter\n          can
        click the appropriate button to make a binding offer for conclusion\n          of
        a rental contract by a certain date. The contract stands if the provider\n

        shall also communicate the necessary contract data, especially the\n          duration
        use and total price. The total price consists of the price of the\n          accommodation
        and wimdu's commission. The current commission fees are available\n          at
        %{href_fees} . The settlement of agreed upon conditions such as a safety\n
        \         deposit or cleaning costs is made directly between users.\n        item_03:
        9.3 The renter then pays the total cost. Wimdu collects this money\n          from

        credit card or PayPal, and upon conclusion of the rental contract,\n          will
        be debited and kept by wimdu in a non-interest bearing escrow account\n          for
        the benefit of the provider. Should the amount receivable not be paid,\n          the
        user must reimburse wimdu for the additional costs to the extent that\n          it
        is his failure. Providers are not allowed to add additional costs or\n          fees,
        which were not specified in the tendered price, and then demand these\n          from
        the renter.\n        item_04: 9.4 The registration as a user of wimdu is free.
        wimdu does not charge\n          for listing offers. Should a rental contract
        be concluded between a provider\n          user and a renter user as result
        of provable service or brokering, which\n          took place on the wimdu
        website, the provider is to pay wimdu a processing\n          fee. The current
        processing fees are available at the %{href_cancellation_policy}\n          page.\n
        \       item_05: 9.5 The commission is due immediately upon conclusion of

        with the escrow administered\n          rental fee. Should the debt recovery
        fail, the user must reimburse wimdu\n          for the additional costs incurred
        to the extent that it is his failure.\n        item_06: 9.6 Users may only
        set off due and/or future claims of wimdu commissions\n          unless these

        users by e-mail of any such changes taking effect on the website\n          in
        due time. The change is effective for any provably obtained or brokered\n
        \         rental contracts, and unless the user objects within four weeks,
        wimdu shall\n          expressly point out the dissemination of amendment
        to user.\n        item_09: 9.9 The user herewith assigns wimdu to pay the

        not have been left to him in the contractual state.\n          In this case,
